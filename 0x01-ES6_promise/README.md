This project is part of the curriculum of the ALX Software Engineering program. The main objective of this project is to understand and implement JavaScript Promises.

## Learning Objectives <a name="learning-objectives"></a>
At the end of this project, I am expected to be able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google:
- Promises (how, why, and what)
- How to use the `then`, `resolve`, `catch` methods
- How to use every method of the Promise object
- Throw / Try
- The await operator
- How to use an async function
