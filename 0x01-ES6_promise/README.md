This directory contains the programming solutions to the tasks of the JavaScript ES6 Promises project, which was done the ALX Software Engineering School. While doing this project, I learnt:
- What Promises are and how to use them.
- the reasons for using JS promises
- how to use the then, catch and resolve methods.
- how to use every method of the Promise object
- how to use throw/try
- how to use the await operator
- how to use an async function
