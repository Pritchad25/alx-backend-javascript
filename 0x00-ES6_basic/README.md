This directory contains solutions to the programming tasks of the ES6 Basics project, which was done at the ALX Software Engineering School.While doing this project, I learnt:
-What ES6 is
-the various new features introduced in ES6
-the difference between a constant and a variable
-what block-scoped variables are
-what arrow functions are and what function parameters default to them
-what Rest and spread function parameters are
-what String templating in ES6 is
-how object creation is done and their properties in ES6
-how to use iterators ad for-of loops.
